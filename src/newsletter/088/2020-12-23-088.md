Hello all,

I'm writing this from the Finger Lakes in Western New York, where I'm with family for the first time since pre-pandemic. We all quarantined and got tested, but it feels foreign to be with others. Like we're doing something wrong. Many of us are growing alien-like in our faintly-used person-to-person interaction skills.

This will be the last issue of *The Curtain* this year. I'll be taking a short break from it for the holidays, and will be back in January with a fresh new Season. As always, thanks for reading through the weird and scary year that was 2020.

## What I Published This Year

I'm now 88 weeks into publishing this newsletter. It's been a fun time, but I'm still learning. Last year [I did a year-in-review of what I wrote](https://guscuddy.substack.com/p/the-curtain-38-2019-year-in-review), and it felt nice. Honestly, I wanted to write more longform pieces and work steadily on some other writing projects this year. But despite the free time, I found it difficult to get anything done at all! Yet I did manage to send out something here every week. Here are some of my favorites, organized by theme:

### culture

-   **[What Happened in 2020?](https://guscuddy.substack.com/p/the-curtain-87-what-happened-in-2020)** - I published this piece last week, looking at lenses in which to view the year in culture.

-   **[Simple Contracts](https://guscuddy.substack.com/p/the-curtain-77-simple-contracts)** - In 2020, reading physical books *felt good*. (But I didn't do it enough.) Why? Partially because of the simple contract you have with a physical book: there's no surveillance capitalism that's leaking in here.

-   **[The end of cities?](https://guscuddy.substack.com/p/the-curtain-71-the-end-of-cities)** - What does the future of New York hold?

-   **[Types of Intimacy](https://guscuddy.substack.com/p/the-curtain-67-types-of-intimacy)** - Thinking about the loss of collective intimacy this year, but the different types of individual and networked intimacy that have become more prominent in 2020.

-   **[Bottom-Up, not Top-Down](https://guscuddy.substack.com/p/the-curtain-52-bottom-up-not-top)** and **‌[What is emerging?](https://guscuddy.substack.com/p/the-curtain-62-what-is-emerging-)** - Bottom-up, emergent thinking is critical to the future: fractals that replicate from small to all.

-   **‌[On Truth in Art: perception, illusion and un-reality in the work of Lucas Hnath, Tina Satter, and the Safdie Bros.](https://guscuddy.substack.com/p/the-curtain-46-how-to-tell-the-truth)** - One of the last things I wrote pre-pandemic, about the great *Dana H*, and the reality-mixing in art.

#### minimalism series

I wrote a couple critiques of minimalism early this year:

-   **[The Cult of Minimalism, and the Untapped Potential of Maximalism](https://guscuddy.substack.com/p/the-cult-of-minimalism-and-the-untapped)**

-   **[The Hidden Conservatism in Minimalism](https://guscuddy.substack.com/p/the-curtain-45-the-hidden-conservatism)**

### theatre & film

-   **[Checking in on Online Theatre](https://guscuddy.substack.com/p/onlinetheatre)** - A review-type piece looking at *Circle Jerk*, *Heroes of the Fourth Turning*, and *American Dreams*. Fake Friends retweeted it:

https://twitter.com/faaakefriends/status/1321506832440004608

-   **‌[On the economics and intricacies of funding online theatre](https://guscuddy.substack.com/p/the-curtain-85-funding-the-future)** - Here I discuss the old and new paradigms around arts funding, centering around theatre. What's the role of institutions in new play development in a rapidly changing future?

-   **[The Disneyfication of Hamilton](https://guscuddy.substack.com/p/the-curtain-64-the-disneyfication)** - *Hamilton* became popular all over again this year. There was a lot of money involved.

-   **[Could film and theatre converge?](https://guscuddy.substack.com/p/the-curtain-58-could-film-and-theatre)** - Looking at Zia Anger's brilliant *My First Film* and Richard Nelson's Zoom play *What Do We Need To Talk About?* (one of the first successful Zoom plays, which feels like ten years ago).

-   **[Early pandemic musings on the long-term outlook of theatre, and whether art is essential](https://guscuddy.substack.com/p/the-curtain-57-the-long-and-the-short)**

-   **‌[A vision for a sustainable future of theatre](https://guscuddy.substack.com/p/the-curtain-54-how-to-build-the-future)** - Short ideas about what it would take to build a sustainable future for theatre.

-   **‌[The Changing Tides of European and American Theatre](https://guscuddy.substack.com/p/european-theatre-vs-american-theatre)** - Why our attitude about Ivo Van Hove has shifted from positive to lukewarm over the last few years.

-   **‌[The Rise of the Influencer Playwright and Director](https://guscuddy.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-the-influencer-playwright)** - .We're in the age of the influencer playwright and director (though with directors, the main influencer-auteurs given platforms are still white men), where the individual can hold far more sway than an institution.

### internet and media

-   **[The experience of the internet: dancing with oblivion](https://guscuddy.substack.com/p/the-curtain-75-dancing-with-oblivion)** - Why do we doom-scroll online? Perhaps a deep drive for eternal Nothingness. Yeah. But not the good kind of [Jenny Odell "How to Do Nothing"](https://bookshop.org/books/how-to-do-nothing-resisting-the-attention-economy/9781612197494) nothingness.

-   **[Why Open Podcasting Matters](https://guscuddy.substack.com/p/the-curtain-59-why-open-podcasting)**: After Spotify bought Joe Rogan's podcast (and made several other huge podcast acquisitions), I wrote about why Spotify's model is bad, and why we should care about the model of open podcasting.

-   **[Substack, Decentralization, and the Future of Arts](https://guscuddy.substack.com/p/substack-decentralization)** - I wrote a series of short columns wrestling with many writers leaving news institutions and starting their own [Substack](https://substack.com/) newsletters this year. This short piece examines the larger cultural shifts at play.

## Notes from the Week

**WTF is happening with this ratatouille musical**

[It started as a joke](https://guscuddy.substack.com/p/the-curtain-83-what-the-tiktok-is), and here we are: 2020 winner Jeremy O. Harris [is producing a benefit reading of the TikTok Ratatouille musical](https://www.playbill.com/article/original-video-creators-tapped-to-provide-music-for-ratatouille-the-tiktok-musical-lucy-moss-to-direct), which is being adapted by *Circle Jerk* creators Michael Breslin and Patrick Foley, choreographed by Ellenore Scott, directed by Lucy Moss. Original video creators are involved too. I think this is a fitting end to the year in theatre for 2020: pure chaos, plus TikTok.

**Speaking of Jeremy O. Harris...**

...[he also produced a fashion collection with SSENSE](https://www.vogue.com/article/jeremy-o-harris-ssense-works-collection-launch).

---

**[Not Writing](https://www.playwrightshorizons.org/shows/trailers/not-writing/)**

Absolutely loved [this vulnerable piece](https://www.playwrightshorizons.org/shows/trailers/not-writing/) from playwright Clare Barron (_Dance Nation_) on her non-writing process. It's refreshing to see a "successful" writer deep dive into her inability to write right now, and also analyze (with a critical eye) the privilege of her success at a young age.

---

**On TAP**

I just recently discovered "[On TAP: A Theatre & Performance Studies Podcast](http://www.ontappod.com/)", which I recommend to anyone interested in theatre and form. Their recent episodes have been excellent, with a rotating panel discussing performance in 2020.

---

**The New York Times Retracted Caliphate**

After a lengthy review, [The New York Times announced that they're retracting their popular podcast](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/18/944594193/new-york-times-retracts-hit-podcast-series-caliphate-on-isis-executioner) on ISIS called *Caliphate*, from 2018, because of poor information and bad reporting. Oh!

---

**The web is all form**

Liked this quote from writer [Robin Sloan](https://www.robinsloan.com/), on how he thinks about creating writing and media on the internet:

> I learned from using those Macs early on that **form is always malleable**. This became even more apparent when the web came into the picture. Think about it: **there's no way to make a web page or a blog that is not an act of playing with its form at the same time as you're creating its content**. So it just seemed natural: the world was always telling me that you worked on those two things -- the container and its contents -- together.
