Hi friends,

I hope you‚Äôre staying well and healthy.

No new original writing from me this week, but as usual a smattering of collected notes and links.

Happy July! Looking forward to a second half of 2020 that goes exactly according to plan, just like the first half.

Let‚Äôs get into it.

### üóí Notes from the Week

_**The Reckoning at The Flea and nonprofit theatre around the country**_

Last week in theatre: NYC company [The Flea decided to maybe start paying its young artists company](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/theater/the-flea-volunteer-payment.html), The Bats. [Helen Shaw considers the many](https://www.vulture.com/2020/06/racial-and-labor-reckoning-at-nycs-flea-theater.html?utm_campaign=vulture&utm_source=tw&utm_medium=s1) angles of which the Flea has been an exploitative‚Äîyet important‚ÄîNew York City theatrical institution over the last 20 years. And the ways in which artists not being compensated for their work‚Äîcreating simultaneous cultures of wealth privilege (for those that have families that can bankroll them), monetary desperation (for everyone else) and radical unworthiness (for everyone)‚Äîis so endemic and institutionalized in the way nonprofit theatre has largely evolved. [Worth a read.](https://www.vulture.com/2020/06/racial-and-labor-reckoning-at-nycs-flea-theater.html?utm_campaign=vulture&utm_source=tw&utm_medium=s1)

üîâ _**Online Spatial Audio Conversations**_

[Cozyroom](https://cozyroom.xyz/) is a new website that allows for "free peer-to-peer spatial audio environments". It's a strangely specific and inviting idea‚Äîperfectly suited for the age of the quarantine‚Äîthat is coupled with a truly "cozy" aesthetic. Along with the new email service [HEY](https://hey.com/), It's a type of technology design that adopts a human-first approach‚Äîtaking ideas from how we interact as humans, rather than how we interact as computers.

ü¶† _**Tracking the Rate of COVID Spread**_

Despite much of the country deciding that the virus is over, we're not out of the woods yet. Two websites I've been looking at for graphical representations of the rate of spread are [Rt.Live](https://rt.live/) and [Covid Act Now](https://covidactnow.org/?s=58173). Both track‚Äîwith slightly different models‚Äîthe infection rate, or the number of people who become infected by an infectious person. In essence, if that number is below 1.0, the spread will go down. But if it's above 1.0, then the spread increases exponentially.

Here are two varying models on New York's infection rate, both showing _very_ little room for error at this point:

ü§Ø _**Movie Screenings are Happening in Fortnite**_

Ahead of Christopher Nolan's upcoming _Tenet_, which seems determined to be the movie that re-opens movie theaters, Fortnite [hosted a screening](https://kotaku.com/watching-inception-in-fortnite-is-weird-but-doesnt-mak-1844175790) of _Inception_. Major "event" companies are experimenting more and more with marketing to the Gen Z popularity of Fortnite‚Äîthere have been several big concerts‚Äîbut a movie screening seems particularly challenging. But with a generation raised on virtual worlds and now experiencing a global pandemic, perhaps experimental spaces like [Fortnite's Party Royale](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/partyroyale)‚Äîwhich is streaming more Nolan movies (lol)‚Äîare...some kind of future? (To be clear, [I have literally no clue what is going on in this video](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/partyroyale).)

_**What ‚ÄúPolarization‚Äù Misses**_

"Polarization" is a trendy word to describe what's happening in our country because on one level, it's totally true: people are divided. But the pop psychology idea [that Ezra Klein posits in his new book](https://newrepublic.com/article/157599/were-not-polarized-enough-ezra-klein-book-review)‚Äîthat polarization is because of our brains, that conservatism and liberalism are related to psychological tendencies‚Äîis a simplistic view of a complex problem. For one, polarization implies that there are two poles that are equally "out there", but this is a false equivalency: one side are racists and white supremacists. Political talk about "polarization" has become a way to talk _around_ issues‚Äîcritiquing the discourse, instead of the thing itself. In reality, the "thing" is quite simple: it's the foundational, systemic racism of our country. Attempts to tip-toe around this because "we're polarized" amounts to meek centrism.

### Recommendation of the Week

_**I May Destroy You**_

 ![](./a97155c8-3e4d-44fe-ba8a-9aeb5d42e0c5_2953x1661.jpeg)

We're really enjoying the new HBO series from writer, director, and actor Michaela Cole, _I May Destroy You_. It's incisive, smart, sad, funny, and terrifically acted. Its writing is incredibly attuned to the myriad of power structures that oppress its characters. I liked and agree with [this piece](https://newrepublic.com/article/158318/may-destroy-much-rape) in The New Republic.
