Hi friends,

Hope you‚Äôre having a great week!

### On Unforgettable Art

_**Simple and complex are not opposites.**_

The Safdie brothers make entertaining-as-hell, anxiety inducing movies that are also subversive, getting at deeper truths. Simple stories that stick in your head. In _Good Time_, Robert Pattinson plays a bank robber on a job that goes horribly awry. The plot is straightforward; its after-effects are not.¬†

Here‚Äôs how [they put it](https://a24films.com/notes/2017/08/a-note-from-the-safdie-brothers):

> We‚Äôve often been dually obsessed with a specific type of genre movie.¬†**Thrilling movies that were after something else as subtext**.¬†Popcorn films... Termite art... **Stuff that you consume and later on find that you‚Äôve got these termites inside of you refusing to go away, begging you to answer questions from the film**.

As I‚Äôve been working with my buddy Elijah on writing our own web series, I keep thinking about that idea. _It doesn‚Äôt need to be complicated to be complex. It doesn‚Äôt need to be simplistic to be simple._ It can be entertaining and exhilarating and also be unforgettable.

The termites metaphor is a good one. Great art has an elemental and physical quality to it, as it burrows its way into your subconscious.¬†

Some great art treats this literally. We‚Äôve been obsessed with _Succession_, which just ended its very entertaining and unforgettable second season. In a recent piece for the Atlantic, Megan Garber¬†analyzed its world [in terms of its literal nature metaphors and language](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/10/why-succession-works-so-well-horror/599932/) (spoilers for season 2 in that link). Characters insult each other as bugs and animals. And there is a physicality and elementality to the action and details: many scenes set in bathrooms, an unusual focus on human waste, and the persistent menace of nature. As Garber puts it, ‚Äú_Succession_ is an itchy show.‚Äù Again with those damn termites.

..

Playwright Will Arbery (_Plano_, _Heroes of the Fourth Turning_) recently appeared on the new theatre podcast _[Upstage Left](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/upstage-left-intimate-conversations-with-new-york-theater/id1453432747)_, where he talked about his new play and his thoughts on theatre. Here were my takeaways:

**Mystery:** Great plays have mystery, a sense of the unanswerable. Questions that are more significant than answers. An easy message or¬†moral‚Äîor even an easy question‚Äîis a recipe for forgetting. And¬†plays (great ones) should be unforgettable. In the Safdies‚Äô words, they should plant these termites in your brain that won‚Äôt go away. (This is how I felt with _Plano._ And I see _Heroes_ this weekend.)

Don‚Äôt provide easy answers. Don‚Äôt wrap up nicely. The point of art is not to answer definitively what something means. (Instead, watch a documentary or read an essay.) Theatre is about spending time with people in the same room and witnessing, hearing and having hard, investigative conversations, not reaching for solutions.

**Invitations:** As a playwright, you must build in invitations for other artists to crawl into the play and make it their own. There is an inevitable push and pull between the inevitability of the script and the beating hearts of the actors, designers, and director. This tension leads to magic, the liminal space of unconscious minds connecting.

**Whiteness:** Not enough white artists wrestle with their own whiteness, and the legacy and pervasiveness of white supremacy. (Artists of color have been doing this for a while now.) We need work that exposes itself, gets deep and vulnerable, and reaches somewhere scary, finding new ways to investigate and undo white supremacy and the patriarchy. Arbery has stated this was his goal with _Heroes_:

In other words: _great work is in conversation with the visible world, while simultaneously diving deep and exploring the invisible world of the unconscious and uncanny._

## **üóí Notes from the Week**

#### **[wesley morris on black theater's moment](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/09/magazine/tyler-perry-black-theater.html%0A)**

> He‚Äôs \[Tyler Perry\] there in the salaciously dysfunctional couplings of Jeremy O. Harris (‚ÄúSlave Play,‚Äù ‚ÄúDaddy‚Äù), in the rambunctious episodic sketches of Jordan E. Cooper (‚ÄúAin‚Äôt No Mo‚Äô‚Äâ‚Äù), in the time warps and fraying family ties of Jackie Sibblies Drury (‚ÄúFairview,‚Äù ‚ÄúMarys Seacole‚Äù) ‚Äî as an idea, as an energy, to be channeled, harnessed and critiqued. The Tyler Perry problem is really an ancient, larger worry about blackness and how to present it. How loud is too loud? How black is too black?

> **America needs a black theater. But black theater needs to be all over America, challenging, questioning, provoking, freaking people out, because these actually aren‚Äôt only black plays. They‚Äôre plays about race, and the experience of one race watching another, watching it not only suffer and struggle but also inspect itself.**

Another wonderful piece from Wesley Morris.

#### **helen shaw is the new ny mag critic**

After we [bemoaned the loss](https://www.guscuddy.com/2019/09/28/state-of-criticism/) of Sara Holdren a few weeks ago, Vulture/NY Mag announced that [Helen Shaw](https://twitter.com/helen_e_shaw?lang=en) is taking over as its theatre critic. Shaw is one of my other favorite theatre critics working right now.

Here she is in [an interview with](https://www.americantheatre.org/2019/10/11/helen-shaw-wants-to-be-the-anthony-bourdain-of-theatre/) _[American Theatre](https://www.americantheatre.org/2019/10/11/helen-shaw-wants-to-be-the-anthony-bourdain-of-theatre/)_:

> **Here‚Äôs my actual goal: to be the Anthony Bourdain of theatre in New York. I want to say to readers: You have no idea that you want to go to this weird corner and eat these spicy noodles, but trust me, you‚Äôll love it. If I could do one millionth of that for theatre, I‚Äôd be happy.**
