LIL NAS X

This week, Lil Nas X performed a masterclass in celebrity showmanship. After releasing his new single and music video [Montero (Call Me By Your Name)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6swmTBVI83k), where he explores his own queerness through a surreal romp through biblical homophobia, the rapper/gen-z-digital-performance-artist dropped an illegally modified Nike sneaker, in collaboration with Brooklyn-based art collective [MSCHF](https://mschf.xyz/), which contained (allegedly) human blood. Well that riled up some folks!

Lil Nas X [smacked angry Twitter personalities](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/arts/music/lil-nas-x-twitter-sneakers-outrage.html) --- your right-wing trolls, your conservative media --- with stunning, balletic finesse. Ten years ago, the video alone would have been enough to generate virality and outrage. But in 2021's internet, the after-show is part of the performance: the 21-year-old Lil Nas X is making clear that he's always one step ahead.

Lil Nas X is one example of a new class of performers on the internet.




"And “Montero” anticipates the kerfuffles it would cause. The true art here isn’t the music (that said, it’s one of Lil Nas X’s better songs) or the video (more on that below): it’s the effortlessness, the ease, the joy of his reactions to the reactions. It’s the sense that he is playing chess to everyone else’s lame checkers moves — he is simply faster, funnier and on firmer, more principled ground than his adversaries, who are at best, comically flimsy."
"No famous person is as adept as Lil Nas X at casually but thoroughly smacking down the ream of Twitter churls inevitably awakened by something like this — maybe Cardi B, or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. He is a grade-A internet manipulator and, provided all the tools and resources typically reserved for long-established pop superstars, he is perfectly suited to dominate the moment. “Montero” may or may not top the Billboard Hot 100 next week, but it will be unrivaled in conversations started."
