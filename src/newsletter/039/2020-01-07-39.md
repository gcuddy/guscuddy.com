Happy new year! And hello to any new subscribers. Hope your January is off to a great start.

This week there’s no new writing by me, as I’m just coming back from vacation. Instead, I’ve been reading and collecting a lot of links on theatre and culture, the most significant of which are below. Enjoy and I’ll see you next week.

#### [Helen Shaw on the Decade in Theater](https://www.vulture.com/2019/12/the-2010s-in-theater-spidey-hamilton-gatz-and-much-more.html)

For anyone that cares about the state and future of theatre (especially in New York), [this piece by Helen Shaw](https://www.vulture.com/2019/12/the-2010s-in-theater-spidey-hamilton-gatz-and-much-more.html) is a must-read.

Shaw’s immense knowledge of the history of New York’s downtown scene shines through. I’m excited for her post at Vulture to include more of this sort of birds-eye-view essay.

> **One New York era faded (of experimental collectives) and another began (the Influencer Playwright)**; we lost and then regained our belief in documentary theater; we dealt with major habitat degradation and resource-diversion; and we’ve **suffered a crisis of confidence in theater’s purpose, which, based on our near-hysterical insistence on the “importance of stories,” you can tell is still at low ebb**

The movement from experimental collectives to influencer playwrights is the most significant trend I have observed as well. But I love the barb about theatre constantly reminding us of the importance of stories.

And:

> **Purposelessness is itself a kind of sacred purpose**. A theater is a place for chaos, thievery, destruction, misrule, recklessness, imagination, adventure, courage, provocation, and possibility. Throw your MFAs into a bonfire! Forget the rules! The wilderness has always been the place for wild beasts—but also hermits on their pillars. Don’t despair if you don’t find an obvious mission there. Go back into the wild. It’s where saints go to study.

#### The Best Plays of the Decade

Here’s Jeremy O. Harris [from Twitter](https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1212892335182356480):

> Is god is  
> An octoroon  
> I’ll never love again  
> Asshole  
> Claustrophile  
> Endlings  
> Tent revival  
> we are proud to present a presentation  
> Gatz  
> Is this a room?  
> This American wife  
> Barbecue  
> This great country  
> Mary Jane  
> O, earth

This is a fantastic list, with more great suggestions in [the replies on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1212892335182356480).

My pick is also for _An Octoroon_ by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins.

#### Soraya McDonald

I loved Soraya McDonald's recent essay **[Wandering in Search of Wakanda](https://theundefeated.com/features/wandering-in-search-of-wakanda/)**, where she considers different visions of utopias as seen in the play _Ain't No Mo_, Beyoncé's _Homecoming_, and David Byrne's _American Utopia_. I've really enjoyed McDonald's 2019 writing covering theatre and culture; she is an inspiration. So it’s fitting that it was also just announced that she won the [Nathan Award](http://as.cornell.edu/news/online-cultural-critic-wins-2019-20-nathan-award) for 2019, an exciting award for theatre criticism.
