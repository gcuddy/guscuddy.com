Hey all,

Hope you‚Äôre having a great Tuesday!

++

First, a few quick notes on some things that inspired me this week.

Tonight I saw _The Farwell_, which was wonderful. I recommend you see it if you get a chance. It just [set the box office record for best theatre average](https://variety.com/2019/film/box-office/the-farewell-box-office-per-theater-average-awkwafina-lulu-wang-1203267055/) this year, which may or may not be a meaningless statistic, but it‚Äôs a really great story.

Last night I saw an inspiring DIY variety show at the Magnet Theatre called [Maaad Late](https://magnettheater.com/show/53312/)!. The idea was that the whole thing was an improvised late night talk show, complete with a special guest and musical performance. While the show was funny, it actually moved me more than anything else: to see regular people get up and talk about what‚Äôs going on in their lives (in the special guest bit), and especially the musical performance, in which De La Cruz brought a dancer named Soundcloud who he found performing on the subway to do his first ever gig and tell a bit about his story. It‚Äôs maybe silly, but it made me happy to be in New York, and happy to be a human.

Something else that made me happy to be a New York human this week? Seeing people talk to one another and cooperate during the Manhattan blackout ‚Äî it‚Äôs amazing how, even without traffic lights, people actually find a way to make it work. We didn‚Äôt devolve into anarchy. (Something that made me less happy? Our performance of _A Strange Loop_ getting cancelled.)

## Notes from the week

#### **[Pleasure as an organizing principle](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/07/11/pleasure-as-an-organizing-principle/)**

The world under capitalism deals with pain as its organizing principle:

> **The organizing principle of the modern world is pain. Avoiding it, yes. But also trading in it, taking refuge in it, and using it to justify our actions**. Pain has so many uses. Why would you ever give up such a versatile tool?

What would it mean instead to re-frame our organizing principle to be around pleasure? I loved this article by Tiago Forte that asks that question, summarizing the work of activist adrienne marie brown (whose books I have now bought and started reading).

Brown‚Äôs new book is [Pleasure Activism](https://www.amazon.com/Pleasure-Activism-Politics-Emergent-Strategy/dp/1849353263): ‚ÄúUltimately, pleasure activism is us learning to make justice and liberation the most pleasurable experiences we can have on this planet.‚Äù It‚Äôs so far an invigorating and provocative read.

It‚Äôs made me think seriously about how much of our world is centered around pain, ideas like you must suffer for work and that sacrifice is inherently goodd. There‚Äôs a lot to consider here, and I haven‚Äôt fully unpacked it.

But it made me think back to that viral ‚Äú[How Millennials Became the Burnout Generation](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work)‚Äù piece, which is an excellent read if you haven‚Äôt read it:

> Why can‚Äôt I get this mundane stuff done? Because I‚Äôm burned out. **Why am I burned out? Because I‚Äôve internalized the idea that I should be working all the time**. Why have I internalized that idea? Because **everything and everyone in my life has reinforced it ‚Äî explicitly and implicitly ‚Äî since I was young**.

Tech, social media, student debt, the cult of optimization, etc has made us think that we need to be on the clock 24/7, always working, always suffering. How can we lift away this pain and move towards pleasure?

#### Uptown/downtown, Broadway/Off-Broadway worlds continue to meld

With [the announcement](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/theater/slave-play-jeremy-harris-broadway.html) that Jeremy O. Harris‚Äô _Slave Play_ (directed by Robert O‚ÄôHara) is going to Broadway, the trend of the [uptown/downtown wall being torn down](https://www.americantheatre.org/2019/03/26/uptown-vs-downtown-tear-down-this-wall/) continues, following a Broadway season that produced the work of Heidi Schreck, Daniel Fish, Taylor Mac, and Young Jean Lee. I also [wrote about this](https://guscuddy.substack.com/p/the-curtain-52119-) in May.

I think this is really big news for theatre, and a potential encouraging sign for its future. Jeremy and the producers are subsidizing 10,000 tickets to make them available for $39, which to be honest I don‚Äôt think is cheap enough, but is a start. (It also doesn‚Äôt change the fact that, for some absurd reason, you can buy a ‚Äúpremium ticket‚Äù for $227 for the show.) There have been also ‚Äúgrassroots‚Äù efforts to subsidize that $39 ticket price [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1150072414635790341) for anyone that wants to go, which is an interesting thing I‚Äôm seeing pop up more and more online. (And is made more potent by Jeremy and the show‚Äôs popularity on social media.)

And while I‚Äôm a fan of Jeremy and Robert and the play, it‚Äôs important to remember that the show was not at all [without](https://www.theroot.com/rising-playwright-jeremy-o-harris-addresses-backlash-o-1831545447) [its](https://hyperallergic.com/482536/a-close-reading-of-slave-play-interrogates-the-burden-of-interracial-trauma/) [critics](https://twitter.com/brownblaze/status/1078024999972159488). [There‚Äôs a lot to unpack](https://fashioningtheself.tumblr.com/slaveplay). But the marketing for the Broadway run is really pushing that [Wesley Morris quote](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/theater/african-american-playwrights.html) that it‚Äôs ‚Äúthe single most daring thing I‚Äôve seen in a theater in a long time,‚Äù which is about as good an endorsement as you can get.

#### Maria Striar on ticket prices, recycling sets and making it happen

[Great interview](https://www.theintervalny.com/interviews/2019/05/an-interview-with-maria-striar/) with Clubbed Thumb Artistic Director Maria Striar in [The Interval](https://www.theintervalny.com) (RIP), a company that‚Äôs been killing it for a while but has recently made a bigger name for itself with _What the Constitution Means to Me_ and (to a lesser extent) _Plano_.

> It‚Äôs really important for us that it‚Äôs **ambitious, but low stakes**. There‚Äôs a calibration of shoot for the moon, don‚Äôt be lazy, don‚Äôt be unambitious, but also don‚Äôt be scared, don‚Äôt hedge your bets. **You can try something out and if it doesn‚Äôt quite work, we‚Äôre all going to be okay**.
> 
> We are very good at **doing a lot with a little‚Ä¶You can take somebody else‚Äôs leftover set parts, and you repurpose your own set parts**, and you do all kinds of clever, thrifty things that require a little bit more scheming and engagement**‚Ä¶**There is part of me that is so deeply downtown-y and scroungy and **really hates waste**. So I like that back and forth of using resources, as long as within the parameters of not wasting people‚Äôs time and not clipping people‚Äôs wings. **The set budgets for Clubbed Thumb can‚Äôt cost more than the artistic. People first, stuff second or third, down the line.**
> 
> **I think the most important thing is striving to pay people**. It is so expensive. The city is so expensive to live in. Everything you can do to put money in the hands of young artists or other types of theatre practitioners is allowing the presence of this form in this city to continue. I feel like that is my highest priority. **I also feel like it‚Äôs really, really important to keep ticket prices low. I can‚Äôt tell you how many people showed up for the 25 dollar rush tickets. And how many people tell you they don‚Äôt have money for a 20 dollar ticket.**

Plainly put: even $20 can be too much.

#### New York Theatre Workshop continues to crush it

NYTW [announced their full season](http://www.playbill.com/article/oscar-isaac-and-greta-gerwig-to-star-in-three-sisters-off-broadway), which includes a production of _Three Sisters_ starring Oscar Isaac and Greta Gerwig and directed by Sam Gold, Celine Song‚Äôs _Endlings_ directed by 24-year-old Sammi Cannold and featuring a 4,000 gallon water tank, and a new play by Martyna Majok directed by the amazing London-based Rebecca Frecknall.

NYTW has their problems as well, like any Off-Broadway institution, but they have consistently been doing great work for many, many years, and I imagine one or more of these productions will become a major hit and/or transfer to Broadway. They continue to be one of the institutions in New York that I am most excited about. (But they need cheaper tickets, and a more easily accessible rush system ‚Äî theirs is a total mess, but that‚Äôs not a unique problem.)

#### [What](https://deadline.com/2019/07/heidi-schreck-broadway-what-the-constitution-means-to-me-recoupment-2-5-million-capitalization-1202646464/) _[What the Constitution Means to Me](https://deadline.com/2019/07/heidi-schreck-broadway-what-the-constitution-means-to-me-recoupment-2-5-million-capitalization-1202646464/)_ [Recouping its Broadway Capitalization](https://deadline.com/2019/07/heidi-schreck-broadway-what-the-constitution-means-to-me-recoupment-2-5-million-capitalization-1202646464/) Means to Me

_Constitution_ made back its money on Broadway, which is another very positive sign that downtown theatre sells on Broadway, and that the old-world thinking of ‚Äúhit-making‚Äù is pretty much dead. The internet has made it so that audiences are able to discern more clearly what is great and what‚Äôs not ‚Äî they don‚Äôt want to be merely spoon-fed ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù in the classic Broadway sense.

Of course, there are also lots of holes in this argument. Tickets are still too damn expensive. This play has a simple set and small cast, so is not exactly expensive to produce, and just now made its money back after a relatively long run. (Which indicates that producing theatre is just too expensive!) And as usual, so much money being tied up in any one show (and this is peanuts compared to other, larger shows) does have quite a sickening feeling to it, and it‚Äôs tied to a deeper, systemic money problem at American theatre‚Äôs very core; that is, an existential crisis of participating in a capitalist market economy.

#### [Thinking critically about staging gendered violence](https://howlround.com/are-we-traumatizing-people)

A very good conversation in Howlround about the perils of staging gendered violence (specifically the nunnery scene in _Hamlet)_, and the nature of trauma.

> What is the purpose of staging and showing such explicit violence? Is this a shorthand for thinking about moral flaws? Is staging violence a way of saying the perpetrator of violence suffers from mental illness? Is it just saying, ‚Äú**Rather than actually considering other aspects of the text, we‚Äôre going to use a moment of violence as some other way of showing internal struggle or personal turmoil or emotional conflict**‚Äù?

They also discuss _Nanette:_

> Jess: That makes me think of Nanette, the Hannah Gadsby special.¬†
> 
> Emer: Yes!¬†
> 
> ¬†Jess: **Part of what she‚Äôs doing is unraveling the idea that you need to subject yourself to violence in order to ease tension**.
