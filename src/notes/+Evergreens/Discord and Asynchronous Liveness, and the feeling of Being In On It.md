All of a sudden, seemingly overnight, I've become the kind of person who has [[Discord]] open all the time. I'm not sure what exactly happened; at the beginning of this year I barely knew what Discord was. Now it seems like every online community or membership I look into has its own Discord server, each one bristling with its own personality. For those of you that don't use Discord or have no interest in it, there are some interesting media-psyche and scarcity-liveness elements to it to tease out. %%fix this last sentence%%

Discord is an internet chat service with messaging and voice capabilities. It's sort of like Slack, but with a very different, non-business approach: Discord bills itself as your place to "hang out". It originated as a place for gaming communities, which is entirely not my world so I had kind of written it off as not being for me. But over the last year, spurred on primarily by the Pandemic and our [incessant digitization](https://guscuddy.substack.com/p/the-curtain-091-digitization-begets) %%link needed%%, Discord has quickly expanded to be a place for many online communities to host their own chat room server. It's easy to create a server, and even easier to join new ones (unlike Slack). Which means one can find oneself clicking Discord invites and ending up with a healthy-sized server list.

Technical Capabilities of Discord
There's a host of strange things you can do with Discord communities, like require a user to connect their Ethereum wallet to ensure they are holding a pre-defined amount of a certain token.

Okay, so probably I'm weird, but now I'm in several different Discord communities: one for a piece of note-taking software I use (haha), one for [Blaseball](https://guscuddy.substack.com/p/the-curtain-100-blaseball-and-narrative) %% [[Blaseball]] add link %%, and several "premium"  severs. The premium servers are where things get interesting. %%connect with creator economy?%% Many online communities with a subscription model, like several Substack newsletters I subscribe to, have added a private Discord server as a benefit. For instance, one of the premium Discords I'm all of a sudden in is called [Sidechannel](https://www.garbageday.email/p/welcome-to-sidechannel), which just launched this week. It's a weird collaboration between the popular newsletters of [Casey Newton](https://www.platformer.news/), [Charlie Warzel](https://warzel.substack.com/p/welcome-to-galaxy-brain), [Anne Helen Peterson](https://annehelen.substack.com/), [Eric Newcomer](https://www.newcomer.co/), [Nick Quah](https://hotpodnews.com/), [Delia Cai](https://deezlinks.substack.com/), [Kim Zetter](https://zetter.substack.com/), and [Ryan Broderick](https://www.garbageday.email), which are all generally media/journalism focused outlets. I'm a fan of these newsletters, and a premium subscriber to Garbage Day (which also has its own Discord!), so I joined the Discord and then all of a sudden found myself as one of 683 people in the live "stage" room listening to Casey Newton give an unfortunate, disappointingly softball interview to Mark Zuckerberg.

I looked into the react-to-the-stage channel and thankfully saw most people reacting the same way I was reacting: confusion and disgust. But this was just a taste of the Artificial Scarcity and exclusivity that can be created by Discord.

## Discord and Internet Forums

In a funny way, Discords share a bit in common with the internet forums of yesteryear. Internet forums are still a thing, but they're not nearly as popular as they once were. I used to spend many hours crawling through  the forums of [What.CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What.CD), a long-gone private Torrent Tracker for music. (It was a different time.) There was an aura of exclusivity to those forums, and I learned a lot from them. Thinking back, I have distinct memories of some of the more active users. There were the joke threads, the more serious ones, and the weird ones. Then there was the Power User forum, which was only for users who leveled up to being Power Users on the site (by sharing a certain amount of music), and had a reputation for being the drugs forum, where all the older cool kids discussed the drugs they were doing.

%%Lots of different forum channelsTK: the library, devoted to reading and serious discussion (I learned a lot from one particular user there who was also a Philosophy Grad Student); 

There was also the What.CD IRC server --- Internet Relay Channel --- which really is the true precursor to Discord.%%

Private Discords and old private forums both have the feeling of being somewhere special on the vast, formless void of the internet; they lend themselves to an exclusive-feeling emotional-spatiality that is often missing online. (Whether this spatiality is good for our brains or a form of dissociation, [as technology writer L.M. Sacasas would put it](https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/the-insurrection-will-be-live-streamed), is another matter.) There are many other parts of the internet that mirror this effect, but they all share in common something peculiar: the feeling that you're in on something, that you have a fun place to simply "hang out", in Discord's terminology. It might make us feel less alone while plugging in to the matrix of the internet.

%% - [ ] maybe add: asynchronous liveness, or write next week %%



%%But the significant connection between that What.CD forum and Discord is that both have the feel of being sort of special, sort of exclusive. They both feel like you're "getting in on it", like you're in a special community. Even the larger Discords I'm in (none are above a couple thousand people) have the feel of being a fun place to hang out on the internet. I don't keep up or even post, necessarily, but I do enjoy scrolling through, or recognizing particular active users. It's a place that makes the internet feel less alone. That you're "in" with a group of people. (Be warned: Sacasas might call this psychosis.)%%


%%- This exclusivity created by Discord has reverberations of the idea of Artificial Scarcity that I've written about before. It's interesting --- it's on a particular spectrum of liveness, a spectrum we might consider the scarcity of liveness. Here I don't mean liveness as in physical liveness, but as in happening in-the-moment. Discord is a type of Asynchronous Liveness: it's fine to drop in and out, as conversations aren't necessarily expected to happen in real time. It's not as Asynchronous as, say, traditional internet forums, or even writing letters (though there is a type of synchronousness that that has today too). It's also not as Synchronous as the experience of Live Theatre, for instance, or anything else that happens with true Synchronicity%% %% I don't think that word means what I think %%
