{Cloze deletion} is a way of formatting fill-in-the-blank flashcards for spaced repetition systems.
<!--ID: 1618866359184-->

It's especially useful for writing notes in your PKM and then turning those notes, automatically, into prompts in [[Anki]]. You can use a script/plugin like [[Obsidian to Anki Plugin]] to help with that. Alas, ever since I switched the vault location, that Plugin has been running excruciatingly slowly for me â€” it freezes my vault up. So I'm looking for a new solution now! (open question)
