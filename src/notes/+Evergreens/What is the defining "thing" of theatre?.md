What is theatre's defining "thing"?

Here are some possibilities:

- Ephemerality: theater appears, then disappears (see: [[Is Ephemerality an essential quality to theatre?]])
- Scarcity: theater exists in one place, at one time (see: [[Scarcity is inherent to theater — isn't it?]], [[§Artificial Scarcity 20210310]])
- Ritual: ([[Theatre as ritual]])
	- ![[The Qualities of Great Theatre#Great theatre is an event-ritual]]
- Theater as having a "civic role", in the Ancient Greek sense: [[Theater as a part of a functioning city]] ![[Ivo Van Hove on re Directing Zoom notes#Civic role of theater]]
- [[Theater as a space for collective dreaming and unconscioous]]
	- Ivo talks about this in [[Ivo Van Hove on re Directing Zoom notes#Civic role of theater]]
		- Also in Theatre Laid Bare

Other possibilities:
- Politics?
- Justice?
- Democracy?
