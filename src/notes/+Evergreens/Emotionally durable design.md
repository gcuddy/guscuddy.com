Coinage from Jonathan Chapman, and brought to my attention by Kieran Fenby-Hulse's paper "Rethinking the Digital Playlist: Mixtapes, Nostalgia and Emotionally Durable Design":.

Fenby-Hulse considers the *mixtape* as an example of "emotionally durable design": it's a physical object with an "aesthetic, craft-like process".

"Narrative, attachment, enchantment, surface, and consciousness" are embedded into the design process. 

"The challenge that we face now is how to translate the haptic, material and sonic experience of the mixtape into the digital realm"
