Something I've been trying to do is have "inline tags" in my writing, that I can then query with searches across my database. For me that's "open question".

But here's an open question: do I make it into a tag? Or do I make it into a page ie [[open question]]?

If I do the latter I can have ad-hoc "MOC" with either Embedded Search or Dataview. Dataview can be n
ice because I can just print out all the pages that link to it (basically just the backlinks, but described in the way I want).
