## Error: Out of Space

*"Your silence will not protect you." -- Audre Lorde*

Over the past several months, every one of my e-devices has had its storage space completely filled up. In the case of my old MacBook Pro, it makes it sufferingly slow, and prone to strange behavior and error messages. It lacks a sense of vibrancy and ease, which are strange ways to describe a computer, until you spend time on a fast computer and then all day on a slow computer and realize the difference. Then it becomes easy to endow a computing ==device== with qualities like speed. As I write this, and try to edit a previous sentence, I get a dreaded spinning beach ball of doom; the friction is *almost* enough to make me want to write by hand instead.

My phone, whose backside is almost completely crumbling, barely held together by its case, is not only entirely out of space from all the photos from quarantine, and the movie that we shot but haven't edited from September, but has had its wiFi broken for many months; only cellular data works on it, and even then, it's dodgy. 

I want to replace them this year, sure, but they've been through a lot with me. Recently I got a great big 27 inch 4K monitor to connect my aging laptop to; it feels partially like a fresh rejuvenation, like I can see things again; it frees up some *energy*. Not a lot, but some.

*Energy*. Oh, energy! For brief spurts of time, I feel like my computer is young again. I whiz through web pages, smile as I drop files ==like paper weights here and there==, hell, maybe I even try to play a video, and look, wow, Chrome has 100 tabs split across four different windows, surely that can't be a proble;;;:~~~.....
