[[Rob Burbea]] gives three, progressive avenues of practice for meditation practitioners:

1. Bare attention / simple mindfulness / stress reduction
2. Practices that "undo fabrication", or unfabricate towards emptiness
3. Practices that deliberately fabricate ie imaginal practice

As you grow in experience as a meditator, the second and the third practices become a lot more important. (Though simple stress reduction is also important.)
