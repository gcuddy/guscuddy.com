I'm a writer, performer, designer/developer, and thinker.

I'm interested in soul-expanding theatre, strange internet ephemera, and the potentials and perils of the future.

Currently I'm writing about cultural psyches, media philosophy, performance and the internet.

When the world isn't in a global pandemic, I regularly perform in theatre in New York and around the country.
