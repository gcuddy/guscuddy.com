<h1 class="measure-micro align-center">Gus is <a href="/archives">writing</a>, <a href="/about#acting">performing</a>, designing, thinking.</h1>

I'm interested in soul-expanding theatre and film, strange internet ephemera, and the potentials and perils of the future.

I make and perform theatre and film, and write essays and other stuff online.

This is my web home. My own experimental warehouse: a [worry stone](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/), [a shifting house next to a river of knowledge](https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/); a place to [cultivate web space](/newsletter/089/) and seek [digital texture](/newsletter/090/).
