I'm interested in soul-expanding theatre and film, strange internet ephemera, and the potentials and perils of the future.

This is my web home. My own experimental warehouse, a [worry stone](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/), [a shifting house next to a river of knowledge](https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/). I'm [cultivating web space](/newsletter/089/), seeking [digital texture](/newsletter/090/).
