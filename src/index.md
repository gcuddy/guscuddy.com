I wear a few different hats: a writer, researcher, programmer & designer, and actor/director. I'm interested in getting free, soul-expanding film and theatre, beautiful software and tools for thought, and the potentials and perils of the future.

Right now most of my time is spent building my read-later/research organizing app, [Margins](https://margins.gg/).

This is my web home. My own experimental warehouse: a place to [cultivate web space](/curtain/089/) and seek [digital texture](/curtain/090/).
